# Optimizing Linux boot time

This project focuses on optimizing the boot time of Linux systems, including improvements for U-Boot, the Linux kernel, and systemd. It provides recipes and guidelines for reducing boot time, making your system start faster by measuring and optimizing key components of the boot process.

## goals

- Measure and analyze boot time using various tools.
- Identify bottlenecks in the boot process.
- Apply optimizations to reduce the overall boot time.
- Document best practices and recipes for kernel, U-Boot, and systemd optimizations.

## structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **measuring boot time**  
   Learn how to measure boot time accurately using tools like `systemd-analyze`, `bootchart`, and `dmesg`. Establish a baseline to track improvements.

1. **optimize boot time**  
   Implement general optimizations, such as reducing the number of services, running tasks in parallel, and tweaking other system settings to improve boot time.

1. **configuring the linux kernel for faster boot**  
   Focus on kernel-specific optimizations, including removing unnecessary modules, enabling initrd, and adjusting kernel parameters for faster boot.

1. **optimizing u-boot and boot strategies**  
   Explore U-Boot optimizations, including reducing delays, adjusting environment variables, and implementing advanced boot strategies like `kexec` and multi-stage booting.

1. **boot time measure: before and after optimization**  
   Track and compare boot times before and after optimization. This section provides a way to measure the impact of optimizations using time logs, charts, and graphs.

# Optimizing Linux boot time

As part of [redpesk OS](https://docs.redpesk.bzh/docs/en/master/redpesk-os/os-overview/docs/overview-redpesk-os.html) development, we were asked to generate some smaller image. This required some investigation about how we can [measure the boot time](https://docs.redpesk.bzh/docs/en/master/download/minimal-image/redpesk-metrics.html) from the first bootloader to the Linux kernel, then by using systemd. In addition, we created some recipes here which will certainly help you to reduce both redpesk OS size and boot time.

This project focuses on optimizing the boot time of Linux systems, including improvements for U-Boot, the Linux kernel, and systemd. It provides recipes and guidelines for reducing boot time, making your system start faster by measuring and optimizing key components of the boot process.

## What are our goals?

- Measure and analyze boot time using various tools
- Identify bottlenecks in the boot process
- Apply optimizations to reduce the overall boot time
- Document best practices and recipes for Linux kernel, U-Boot, and systemd optimizations

Please note in our usecase, we used the [BeagleBoard BeaglePlay](https://docs.redpesk.bzh/docs/en/master/redpesk-os/boards/docs/boards/beagleplay.html) as our reference.

## Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **Measuring boot time**  
   Learn how to measure boot time accurately using tools like `systemd-analyze`, `bootchart`, and `dmesg`. Establish a baseline to track improvements.

2. **oOtimize boot time**  
   Implement general optimizations, such as reducing the number of services, running tasks in parallel, and tweaking other system settings to improve boot time.

3. **Configuring Linux kernel for faster boot**  
   Focus on kernel-specific optimizations, including removing unnecessary modules, enabling initrd, and adjusting kernel parameters for faster boot.

4. **Optimizing U-Boot and boot strategies**  
   Explore U-Boot optimizations, including reducing delays, adjusting environment variables, and implementing advanced boot strategies like `kexec` and multi-stage booting.

5. **Boot time measure: before and after optimization**  
   Track and compare boot times before and after optimization. This section provides a way to measure the impact of optimizations using time logs, charts, and graphs.

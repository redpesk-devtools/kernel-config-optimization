# Boot Time Measure: Before and After Optimization

* Measure the boot time before optimizations.
* Track improvements after applying optimizations.
* Present the data visually with time logs, charts, and graphs (e.g., using systemd-analyze blame, bootchart, or even custom scripts to generate graphs).
* Provide a side-by-side comparison of boot times, showing the specific optimizations that led to improvements.

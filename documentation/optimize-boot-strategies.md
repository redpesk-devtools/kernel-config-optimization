# Optimize boot strategies

* General optimizations for boot time (e.g., parallel services, reducing services).
* Optimization tips for systemd and user-space tools.

## Load drivers as modules

Loading drivers as modules instead of compiling them directly into the kernel can optimize boot time in certain scenarios. Here's why and when this approach is beneficial:

Parallel loading of modules

* Benefit: Modules can be loaded asynchronously after the kernel has finished initializing other critical components. This parallelism allows the kernel to boot faster by focusing first on essential subsystems.
  * Example: While the kernel starts system services, the module loader (modprobe or udev) can initialize hardware drivers in the background.

Reduced kernel initialization overhead

* Benefit: When drivers are built into the kernel (built-in), they are initialized sequentially during the boot process. This adds time to the kernel's initialization phase. Loading them as modules defers their initialization until after the kernel has booted, reducing the perceived boot time.
  * Example: Non-essential hardware like USB peripherals can be initialized later as modules.

Smaller kernel image

* Benefit: Building drivers as modules reduces the size of the kernel image. A smaller kernel:
  * Loads faster into memory.
  * Reduces pressure on low-memory systems during early boot stages.
  * Example: Instead of embedding all network drivers in the kernel, only the specific one required for the system can be loaded as a module.

Flexible hardware support

* Benefit: Modular drivers allow the system to load only the drivers needed for the detected hardware. This reduces the time spent initializing drivers for hardware that isn’t present.
  * Example: On a generic embedded system, many unnecessary device drivers (e.g., for different network cards) can be excluded from the boot process unless required.

On-Demand loading

* Benefit: Drivers can be loaded only when the corresponding hardware is detected or accessed. This avoids initializing unused hardware during boot.
  * Example: Filesystems like FAT32 or NTFS can have their drivers loaded only when such a volume is mounted.

Easier debugging and development

* Benefit: Modular drivers can be dynamically added, removed, and reloaded without rebooting. This is especially helpful during the development cycle or when debugging boot-time issues.
  * Example: You can test different versions of a driver by unloading (rmmod) and loading (modprobe) it without recompiling the kernel.

Quicker recovery from failures

* Benefit: If a driver causes a boot failure (e.g., due to bugs or compatibility issues), having it as a module makes troubleshooting easier. You can prevent the module from loading (by blacklisting it) without rebuilding the kernel.
  * Example: A faulty graphics driver can be skipped by modifying the module configuration file instead of recompiling the kernel.

When loading drivers as modules is NOT ideal

While modular drivers offer advantages, they may not always be the best choice:

* Critical Hardware:
  * Drivers required for booting (e.g., storage controllers, root filesystem drivers) must often be built into the kernel to ensure they are available at the earliest stage.
* Embedded Systems:
  * For resource-constrained systems, compiling drivers into the kernel can save the overhead of loading modules and reduce storage used for separate modules.
  * Real-Time Systems:
  Modular loading may introduce latency, which is undesirable in real-time applications.

Best practices for module loading

* Optimize initramfs:
  * Use initramfs to preload essential modules required for booting to avoid delays.
  * Blacklisting unnecessary modules:
  Avoid loading unused modules by blacklisting them in /etc/modprobe.d/.
  * Use modprobe configurations:
  * Customize the order and conditions for module loading in /etc/modules or equivalent files.
  * Asynchronous module loading:
  Ensure your system’s init system (e.g., systemd, udev) supports asynchronous module loading for parallelization.

Loading drivers as modules is a flexible and efficient way to optimize Linux kernel boot time, particularly for non-critical or optional hardware. However, it should be balanced with the system's requirements, ensuring that critical drivers are available early in the boot process.

## Storage devices

Storage devices play a crucial role in optimizing boot time because the kernel and userspace depend on the storage subsystem to load critical data, including the root filesystem, libraries, and application binaries. Efficient handling of storage devices can significantly reduce boot time by minimizing delays during initialization and access. Here's why and how storage devices impact boot time optimization:

### Early availability of root filesystem

Impact:

* The kernel needs the root filesystem to continue booting into userspace. Delays in detecting or initializing the storage device containing the root filesystem will halt the boot process.

Optimization:

* Use built-in drivers (`CONFIG_*`) for the storage controller of the root filesystem to ensure it's available as early as possible.
* Avoid using modular drivers (`CONFIG_MODULES`) for critical storage hardware unless managed efficiently with initramfs.

### Driver initialization time

Impact:

* Some storage drivers take longer to initialize due to complex hardware or broad compatibility (e.g., SCSI controllers, RAID controllers).

Optimization:

* Disable unnecessary storage drivers in the kernel configuration (`CONFIG_*`).
* Use faster storage technologies like NVMe instead of SATA or HDDs when possible.
* Ensure only the required drivers are loaded during boot by disabling auto-detection of unused storage devices.

### U-Boot and kernel interaction

Impact:

* In embedded systems, U-Boot or other boot-loaders handle storage initialization before passing control to the kernel. A slow or misconfigured bootloader can delay storage detection.

Optimization:

* Configure U-Boot to initialize only essential storage devices.
* Minimize unnecessary checks like scanning for all partitions or storage types.

### Filesystem type

Impact:

* The choice of filesystem affects the time required to mount and access the root filesystem.

Optimization:

* Use filesystems optimized for boot performance, such as ext4, which has faster mounting times than more complex filesystems like btrfs or xfs.
* Disable journaling features if not required (e.g., in read-only root filesystems).

### Parallelization of storage initialization

Impact:

* If multiple storage devices are present, initializing them sequentially increases boot time.

Optimization:

* Enable asynchronous probing of storage devices (`CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC`).
* Use kernel parameters like `rootdelay=0` to avoid unnecessary delays waiting for slow devices.

### Use of modern storage interfaces

Impact:

* Legacy storage interfaces like PATA or slow USB storage introduce bottlenecks during boot.

Optimization:

* Use modern storage interfaces like NVMe, SATA III, or eMMC for faster initialization and data transfer.
* Disable support for unused legacy storage interfaces.

### Initramfs optimization

Impact:

* An inefficient initramfs can delay the loading of storage drivers and mounting the root filesystem.

Optimization:

* Include only essential storage drivers in initramfs to reduce its size and load time.
* Avoid adding unnecessary filesystems or tools to initramfs.

### Partitioning scheme

Impact:

* Complex partitioning schemes with multiple filesystems can increase the time needed to locate and mount partitions.

Optimization:

* Use a simple partitioning scheme with a single root filesystem.
* Avoid scanning for partitions unnecessarily during boot.

### Storage device power-On delays

Impact:

* Some storage devices (e.g., spinning hard drives or external USB drives) take longer to become operational.

Optimization:

* Use SSDs or eMMC storage, which have minimal power-on delays.
* Disable or blacklist drivers for removable or unused storage devices.

### Preloading critical files

Impact:

* Loading files on demand during boot can cause delays if the storage subsystem is slow.

Optimization:

* Preload critical binaries, libraries, and configuration files into memory using mechanisms like tmpfs.
* Optimize disk I/O operations during boot by defragmenting or reorganizing critical files.

### Use of device tree in embedded systems

Impact:

* In embedded systems, the Device Tree describes hardware, including storage devices. Improper configuration can delay initialization.

Optimization:

* Ensure the device tree contains only the necessary storage devices and controllers.
* Disable probing for non-existent storage hardware in the Device Tree.

### Kernel parameters for storage

Impact:

* Kernel parameters control storage-related behavior and can introduce unnecessary delays if misconfigured.

Optimization:

* Use `root=/dev/<device`> or `root=UUID=<uuid>` to specify the root filesystem directly, avoiding scanning for partitions.
* Set `rootfstype=<fstype>` to eliminate filesystem autodetection overhead.

### Avoid Over-Scans

Impact:

* The kernel or bootloader might scan for all available storage devices and partitions, even if they are not required.

Optimization:

* Modify fstab and other configuration files to avoid mounting unnecessary filesystems.

### Storage devices Conclusion

By optimizing how storage devices are initialized and accessed, you can significantly improve the boot time of a Linux system. Focus on:

* Minimizing unnecessary storage driver initialization.
* Simplifying the filesystem and partitioning scheme.
* Leveraging modern storage interfaces and technologies.
* Configuring the kernel, bootloader, and initramfs for minimal delays.

Efficient storage management ensures the system can quickly load the kernel, root filesystem, and user-space applications, leading to faster overall boot times.

## preemptive and low-latency kernel

Using a preemptive and low-latency kernel can indirectly optimize kernel boot time in specific scenarios. While their primary goal is to improve responsiveness and reduce latency, these features can also lead to faster boot times under certain conditions. Here’s why:

### Improved scheduling of tasks

Impact:

* Preemptive kernels allow higher-priority tasks (such as boot-critical tasks) to preempt lower-priority ones, ensuring that time-sensitive operations during boot are executed without unnecessary delays.

Optimization:

* Tasks responsible for loading critical drivers, mounting the root filesystem, or starting essential services are executed promptly, potentially shaving seconds off the boot process.

### Reduced latency for critical initialization

Impact:

* A low-latency kernel is tuned to minimize delays in task execution. During the boot process, this can help with:
  * Faster handling of hardware interrupts.
  * Quicker initialization of time-critical hardware and subsystems.

Optimization:

* Subsystems like storage, networking, or device enumeration complete initialization more quickly due to better task prioritization and reduced wait times.

### Asynchronous and parallelized boot processes

Impact:

* Preemptive and low-latency kernels can better handle parallelized initialization of drivers and services. Tasks don't block each other unnecessarily, leading to a more efficient use of available CPU cycles.

Optimization:

* Tasks like udev triggering and kernel module loading benefit from the improved scheduling, completing faster and enabling earlier transitions to userspace.

### Faster interrupt handling

Impact:

* Preemptive kernels prioritize interrupt handling, reducing the time spent on lower-priority tasks. This is particularly useful during boot when hardware interrupts (e.g., from storage or network devices) are frequent.

Optimization:

* Interrupt-driven tasks (like detecting storage devices or initializing network interfaces) complete more quickly, accelerating the overall boot process.

### Better utilization of multi-core CPUs

Impact:

* Preemptive and low-latency kernels are often designed to take advantage of multi-core systems. During boot, multiple tasks can be executed on different cores without one task monopolizing the CPU.

Optimization:

* Tasks such as filesystem mounting, driver initialization, and service startup can run in parallel, reducing the overall boot time.

### Reduced jitter in boot-critical tasks

Impact:

* Non-preemptive kernels or high-latency configurations can cause "jitter" (unpredictable delays) when one task monopolizes the CPU for too long. This is particularly problematic during boot, where certain tasks need deterministic execution.

Optimization:

* A preemptive kernel ensures that boot-critical tasks (e.g., initializing the root filesystem) run predictably, avoiding delays caused by less critical processes.

### Fine-Grained control Over task priorities

Impact:

* With preemption and low-latency configurations, tasks and interrupts can be finely prioritized based on their importance during boot.

Optimization:

* Kernel developers can adjust task priorities to ensure that essential processes are prioritized, resulting in faster boot times.

### Suitable for systems with heavy I/O during boot

Impact:

* Systems with intensive I/O operations during boot (e.g., loading many drivers or initializing large filesystems) benefit from preemption. I/O tasks are scheduled more efficiently, avoiding bottlenecks.

Optimization:

* Disk and network I/O operations complete faster, enabling the kernel to move on to subsequent stages of the boot process.

### Trade-offs

While preemptive and low-latency kernels can optimize boot time, they are not always the best choice for all systems:

* Increased context-switch overhead:
  * Preemption introduces more frequent context switches, which can slightly increase CPU overhead.
* Not ideal for non-interactive systems:
  * For headless or batch-processing systems, the benefits of preemption may not outweigh the trade-offs.
* Complex tuning:
  * Achieving significant boot-time improvements may require careful tuning of task priorities, which can add complexity to development.

### Enable kernel options for low latency

* Preemption model:
  * `CONFIG_PREEMPT` or `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT` for real-time preemption.
* Low-Latency desktop:
  * `CONFIG_HZ_1000` (higher timer frequency).

### Conclusion

Preemptive and low-latency kernels indirectly optimize boot time by ensuring that critical tasks are handled efficiently and promptly. While not a direct boot-time optimization feature, their ability to reduce latency and prioritize important processes can lead to noticeable improvements, particularly in systems with complex initialization requirements or real-time constraints.

## Parallelize initialization

Use multi-threaded or concurrent network initialization where supported by the hardware and kernel.

## Optimizing network configuration reduces boot time

Optimizing network configuration can significantly improve kernel boot time, particularly in systems where networking plays a critical role during initialization. Many network-related tasks, such as interface initialization, DHCP configuration, and protocol stack setup, can introduce delays. By tailoring the network configuration to the system's specific requirements, these delays can be minimized or eliminated.

### Why optimizing network configuration reduces boot time

Avoids unnecessary network interface initialization

* Systems often initialize all network interfaces, even those not in use, adding unnecessary overhead.
* Disabling or deferring initialization for unused interfaces saves time.

* Speeds up IP Address assignment
  * Network interfaces often use DHCP for IP configuration, which can involve multiple timeouts if the DHCP server is slow or unavailable.
  * Optimizing IP assignment reduces these delays.

* Eliminates redundant protocol initialization
  * Initializing unused network protocols or services consumes resources and adds latency.
  * Disabling unnecessary protocols speeds up network stack initialization.

* Reduces dependency on external resources
  * Relying on external services (e.g., NTP servers, DNS resolution) can delay boot if those services are unavailable or slow.

### How to optimize network configuration

Disable unused network interfaces

Why:

* Initializing all network interfaces consumes time, especially if some interfaces are not required.

How:

* Identify unused interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
* Use the kernel configuration (make menuconfig) to disable drivers for unused hardware (e.g., `CONFIG_NETDEVICES`, `CONFIG_WLAN`).
* Alternatively, blacklist unused drivers in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.

### Use static IP addresses

Why:

* Dynamic IP configuration via DHCP introduces delays, especially if the DHCP server is unavailable or the lease process is slow.

How:

* Assign static IP addresses in network configuration files.
  Example (for systemd-networkd):

```bash
        [Match]
        Name=eth0

        [Network]
        Address=192.168.1.100/24
        Gateway=192.168.1.1
        DNS=8.8.8.8
```

### Reduce DHCP timeout

Why:

* DHCP clients often wait for extended timeouts if no server responds.

How:

* Configure shorter DHCP timeouts in the DHCP client configuration.
  * Example (for dhclient):
  Edit /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and set:

```bash
            timeout 5;
            retry 5;
```

Alternatively, use faster DHCP clients like busybox's udhcpc.

### Disable IPv6 if not needed

Why:

* Initializing IPv6 involves additional steps, such as Router Advertisement (RA) processing, which can add delays.

How:

* Disable IPv6 in the kernel with the boot parameter: ipv6.disable=1.
* Alternatively, disable IPv6 for specific interfaces in network configuration files.

### Optimize DNS configuration

Why:

* DNS resolution during boot (e.g., for hostname lookup) can introduce delays if the DNS server is slow or unavailable.

How:

* Use local or cached DNS servers.
* Avoid unnecessary DNS lookups by ensuring the hostname is resolved locally in /etc/hosts.

### Avoid network dependencies during boot

Why:

* Services or applications that depend on network connectivity (e.g., NTP, remote logging) can block the boot process if the network is unavailable.

How:

* Configure such services to start asynchronously after boot.
  Example (for systemd): Use the After=network-online.target directive for dependent services.

### Enable asynchronous network initialization

Why:

* Waiting for network initialization can block other tasks during boot.

How:

* Use asynchronous initialization for network interfaces or defer network-dependent services.
* For example, with systemd, ensure the network.target dependency is met without waiting for network-online.target unless strictly necessary.

### Streamline kernel network configuration

Why:

A bloated kernel configuration initializes unused network subsystems, slowing boot.

How:

* Remove support for unused protocols and features (e.g., legacy protocols, uncommon tunneling options).
  * Example kernel configuration options to disable:
  `CONFIG_BRIDGE` (if bridging is not needed).
  `CONFIG_NETFILTER` (if firewall rules are not required).
  `CONFIG_IPV6` (if IPv6 is not used).

### Minimize network interface renaming

Why:

* Renaming network interfaces (e.g., using udev rules) can introduce delays during boot.

How:

* Use predictable interface names provided by modern kernels (e.g., eth0, enp0s3).
* Avoid custom udev rules unless absolutely necessary.

### Use lightweight network Managers

Why:

* Full-featured network managers (e.g., NetworkManager) can be slow to initialize on lightweight or embedded systems.

How:

* Use simpler alternatives like systemd-networkd or busybox's network tools.

### Optimize wireless network configuration

Why:

* Scanning for available wireless networks can add significant delays during boot.

How:

* Pre-configure Wi-Fi networks with known SSIDs and credentials.
* Disable scanning for networks during boot if not required.

### Preload firmware for network devices

Why:

* Many network devices require firmware loading, which can add delays if the firmware is not readily available.

How:

* Include firmware in the kernel image or initramfs.
* Use tools like dracut or mkinitramfs to bundle firmware.

### Tools for measuring network initialization time

* dmesg:
  * Analyze kernel logs for network-related delays.
* systemd-analyze blame:
  * Identify slow network services.
* initcall_debug:
  * Pinpoint slow network driver initialization.

### Network configuration cConclusion

Optimizing network configuration focuses on tailoring the initialization of network interfaces, protocols, and dependencies to the system's specific requirements. By reducing unnecessary work, shortening timeouts, and deferring or disabling unused components, you can achieve significant improvements in kernel boot time. These optimizations are particularly valuable for systems where network functionality is secondary to fast startup.

## User-Space services

### Reduce service load

Use systemd-analyze blame to identify long-running services.

* Disable unnecessary services:

```bash
    systemctl disable service_name
```

### Parallelize service initialization

* Use systemd-analyze critical-chain to identify dependencies and remove unneeded service dependencies.

### Optimize service configuration

* Tune service configurations to reduce resource usage and initialization times. For example:
  * Adjust timeout values for network services.
  * Minimize database startup times by preloading essential data.

## Power management

### Disable unused power features

In kernel configuration, disable unused power-saving mechanisms like ACPI or cpuidle if not needed.

### Optimize CPU frequency scaling

Use static CPU frequency scaling (performance governor) during boot to reduce initialization delays:

```bash
echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

## Peripheral devices

### Reduce initialization overhead

* Disable unused hardware peripherals in the Device Tree or BIOS/UEFI.
* Preload firmware for peripherals to avoid runtime delays:
        Use `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE` to embed firmware directly into the kernel.

### Compare before and after optimizations

Use tools like dmesg or systemd-analyze to compare boot times before and after optimizations. Example:

```bash
    dmesg | grep 'Freeing unused kernel memory'
```

This gives you a timestamp indicating when the kernel has completed initialization.

## conclusion

By leveraging these techniques, you can systematically identify and address boot time bottlenecks in the kernel, leading to a faster and more efficient boot process.
